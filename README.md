# Euclidean algorithm

The repository contains a collection of the **Euclidean algorithm** in various programming languages. For every language, there are two versions of the algorithm itself: one **iterative** and one **recursive**. 

## But... why?

I am aware that literally every-programmer-on-Earth already knows this algorithm and its implementation is really easy, so I can image that all this project must seem pretty trivial. Well... it is. However, I think the code is well structured and documented, and I like to think to it as a good example, as a model of programming. And, why not, maybe it could be really useful for someone.

## Languages

* C#
* Java
* PHP
* Python

For every language, I tried to adapt the code to its own style and naming conventions.
